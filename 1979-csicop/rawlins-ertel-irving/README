Informations given by Kenneth Irving about this file : 
<<
This is the original raw data, which shows Rawlins' listing of name, date, time, plus his sector calculation for each. along with the batch number. However, he included only longitude and latitude, not the city/county or state of birth, nor any notation of standard/daylight. Ertel apparently had an astrologer check the missing information against what Rawlins sent.

Kenneth Irving considers that the information present in this file is preliminary and partial.
